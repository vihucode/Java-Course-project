# Java-Course-project 2023

This is final project for Ohjelmointi 3: Rajapinnat ja tekniikat course. 
I made this project with Katariina Kariniemi and Tuomas MÃ¤kinen.

The task for the project was to recreate a functional Sisu GUI on a smaller scale. Sisu is an application used 
by educational institutions, allowing users to make course selections and view the progress of their studies.

Minimal functionality instruction:
The program allows for examining the structure of degree programs at the University of Tampere. Additionally, 
users can track the progress of their own studies within the program. Users can designate a degree program as
their own and mark courses as completed as their studies advance. 

More documentation about the project functionality can be found from documentation folder and code can be found 
by following path /src/main/java/fi/tuni/prog3/sisu/.
